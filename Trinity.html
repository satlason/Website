<p>I chose Trinity University because this is a place with a great atmosphere, great academics, and a very good soccer team. When I was looking at schools in the U.S. the most important thing was that the academics were good which Trinity fulfills very much. A big part also why I chose Trinity was the fact that I got an offer to play soccer here so that was really interesting. Also is the campus located 5-7 minutes away from downtown San Antonio which is awesome.
<br>At Trinitty are great people both the professors and the students who want to do well and are fun to work with.</br></p>

<p>I am thinking of majoring in Finance or Mathematical Finance. I like business and the whole concept about it and then I also like math so I Finance is perfect for me. I'm not 100% on Finance but I'm like 99% sure that it will be Financ or Mathematical Finance.
<br>One of the main reasons also of why Finance will be my major is beacause I am going to open up my own business one day and I believe that the concepts that I will learn from Finance will help me for my business in the future.</br>
